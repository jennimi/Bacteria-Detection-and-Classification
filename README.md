# Bacteria-Detection-and-Classification
This repository contains the implementation of the study "Detection and Classification of Gram-Stained Bacteria in Microscopic Images Using YOLOv8 with CBAM", submitted to the JIKO Journal (Jurnal Informatika dan Komputer).   It provides the dataset configuration, preprocessing pipeline, and training notebooks used to reproduce the experiments.

The study uses **X. Wangâ€™s Clinical Bacteria Dataset [13]**, which is publicly available on **Zenodo** and does not require institutional ethical approval.
